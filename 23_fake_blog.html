            <h2>About the Artist</h2>
            <p>Having taken up singing as a hobby after immigrating to New Zealand, Wing gained an audience by entertaining
            patients at nursing homes and hospitals in and around Auckland. This prompted suggestions that she release a CD; 
            the result was a debut titled Phantom of the Opera, featuring the title song from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical,
            and a selection of other popular tunes to the accompaniment of a programmed electronic keyboard. Despite her
            unconventional style the recording proved a success, leading to a number of subsequent releases of cover versions
            that eventually gained her an international audience. She has appeared on such shows as SportsCafe and Rove Live.
            She guest starred on South Park in an episode named after her that was first broadcast in March 2005. On the DVD 
            commentary for this episode, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone explain that she had to approve her cartoon
            likeness before allowing her music to be used. Parker also says he received a letter of thanks from her for the
            sales boost she enjoyed as a result of the episode.</p>
            <p>In addition to recordings, Wing has made various appearances in New Zealand, like Massey University Orientation in Wellington.
            On 21 August 2007, Wing made her U.S. debut in San Francisco.[citation needed] Wing performed at the 2008 South by Southwest festival.        
            On May 11, 2008, she performed on the BBC Introducing stage at Radio 1's Big Weekend, singing versions of ABBA's "Dancing Queen"
            and "Mamma Mia" and Elton John's "Candle in the Wind". DJ Scott Mills, who had played Wing during his Radio 1 drivetime shows, 
            had to personally pay to fly her over so she could sing at the festival, in Maidstone.  Wing appeared on New Zealand music TV station,
            C4, in June 2008 for their series Rocked The Nation, where she sang "Pokarekare Ana". Wing toured the United States in the fall
            of 2009. On 25–26 October 2009, she appeared at the Birdland Jazz Club in New York City. On 2 November 2009, she performed 
            at RAZZ in San Francisco. On her official website, Wing announced that she retired from the musical business in June 2015.</p>
